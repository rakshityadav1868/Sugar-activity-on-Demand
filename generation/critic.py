"""One self-review round over freshly generated activity code.

The generated source already passed static validation and the runtime
gate, so it works — but working code can still be shallow: buttons
without handlers, win conditions that never fire, Journal methods that
save nothing real.  This module asks the model to review its own
output once and return either OK or minimal SEARCH/REPLACE fixes.

The critic is strictly fail-safe.  The unpatched source is already
validated and runtime-proven, so on any doubt — unparseable reply,
failed patch, patched code failing validation or the runtime gate —
the original is kept and generation continues as if the critic had
said OK.

        '- The interface remains usable at 1024x768, with allocation-driven '
        'boards/canvases and bounded wrapped labels.\n'
